The findings could point toward a novel biomarker for the evaluation of anti-aging interventions and highlight potential new targets for the prevention or treatment of age-associated brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe study was published online today in the journal Cell Systems.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a group of seniors, some will look older than their peers and some will look younger,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-leader Asa Abeliovich, PhD, professor of pathology and neurology in the Taub Institute for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain at CUMC. \u201cThe same differences in aging can be seen in the frontal cortex, the brain region responsible for higher mental processes. Our findings show that many of these differences are tied to variants of a gene called TMEM106B. People who have two \u2018bad\u2019 copies of this gene have a frontal cortex that, by various biological measures, appears 12 years older that those who have two normal copies.\u201d\n\nStudies have identified individual genes that increase one\u2019s risk for various neurodegenerative disorders, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cBut those genes explain only a small part of these diseases,\u201d said study co-leader Herve Rhinn, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and cell biology in the Taub Institute. \u201cBy far, the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is aging. Something changes in the brain as you age that makes you more susceptible to brain disease. That got us thinking, \u2018What, on a genetic level, is driving healthy brain aging?'\u201d\n\nIn the current study, Drs. Abeliovich and Rhinn analyzed genetic data from autopsied human brain samples taken from 1,904 people without neurodegenerative disease. First, the researchers looked at the subjects\u2019 transcriptomes (the initial products of gene expression), compiling an average picture of the brain biology of people at a given age. Next, each person\u2019s transcriptome was compared to the average transcriptome of people at the same age, looking specifically at about 100 genes whose expression was found to increase or decrease with aging. From this comparison, the researchers derived a measure that they call differential aging: the difference between an individual\u2019s apparent (biological) age and his or her true (chronological) age. \u201cThis told us whether an individual\u2019s frontal cortex looked older or younger than expected,\u201d said Dr. Abeliovich.\n\nThe researchers then searched the genome of each individual, looking for genetic variants that were associated with an increase in differential age.\n\n\u201cOne variant stood out: TMEM106B,\u201d said Dr. Rhinn. \u201cIt\u2019s very common. About one-third of people have two copies and another third have one copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTMEM106B begins to exert its effect once people reach age 65,\u201d said Dr. Abeliovich. \u201cUntil then, everybody\u2019s in the same boat, and then there\u2019s some yet-to-be-defined stress that kicks in. If you have two good copies of the gene, you respond well to that stress. If you have two bad copies, your brain ages quickly.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found a second variant\u2013inside the progranulin gene\u2013that contributes to brain aging, though less so than TMEM106B. Progranulin and TMEM106B are located on different chromosomes but are involved in the same signaling pathway. Both have also been associated with a rare neurodegenerative disease called frontotemporal dementia.\n\nThe study did not address what role the two genetic variants might have in neurodegenerative disease. \u201cWe were studying healthy individuals, so it is not about disease, per se,\u201d said Dr. Abeliovich. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s in healthy tissue that you start to get disease. It appears that if you have these genetic variants, brain aging accelerates and that increases vulnerability to brain disease. And vice versa: if you have brain disease, the disease accelerates brain aging. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nAbout this genetics and aging research article\n\nFunding: The study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Aging (AG042317), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the Michael J.
