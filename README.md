`py_heideltime` is a python wrapper for the multilingual temporal tagger HeidelTime originally developed
by [Jorge Mendes](https://github.com/JMendes1995) and [Ricardo Campos](https://github.com/rncampos).
This repo is a gross simplification of the original work that reduces the interface and the outputs of the `heideltime`
function. Please do checkout the original [repo](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime) which provides a much more comprehensive overview of the library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install py_heildetime
```

### Install External Resources

In order to use py_heideltime you must have java JDK and perl installed in your machine for heideltime dependencies.

#### Windows users

To install java JDK begin by downloading it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
Once it is installed don't forget to add the path to the environment variables. On `user variables for Administrator`
add the `JAVA_HOME` as the `Variable name:`, and the path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin`) as the Variable
value. Then on `System variables` edit the `Path` variable and add (e.g., `;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin`) at
the end of the `variable value`.

For Perl, we recommend to download and install the following [distribution](https://strawberryperl.com/). Once it is
installed don't forget to restart your PC. Note that perl doesn't need to be installed if you are using Anaconda instead
of pure Python distribution.

#### Linux users

Perl usually comes with Linux, thus you don't need to install it.

To install `JAVA`:

```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk
```

## How to use

```python
from py_heideltime import heideltime

text = "Thurs August 31st - News today that they are beginning to evacuate the London children tomorrow. Percy is a billeting officer. I can't see that they will be much safer here."

timexs = heideltime(
    text,
    language='English',
    document_type='news',
    dct='1939-08-31'
)

print(timexs)
````

###### Output

```json
[
  {
    "text": "August 31st",
    "tid": "t2",
    "type": "DATE",
    "value": "1939-08-31",
    "span": [6, 17]
  },
  {
    "text": "today",
    "tid": "t3",
    "type": "DATE",
    "value": "1939-08-31",
    "span": [25, 30]
  },
  {
    "text": "tomorrow",
    "tid": "t4",
    "type": "DATE",
    "value": "1939-09-01",
    "span": [87, 95]
  }
]
```
